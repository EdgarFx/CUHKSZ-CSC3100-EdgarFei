# CUHKSZ-CSC3100-Data Structure
cuhksz csc3100 data structure projects

Record the project I have done. It would be great if it can help the students in need (remember not to copy directly, personally suggest that if you have no ideas, you can look at the code here to find ideas, and then try to write it in your own way). Here are all the codes and reports of my four projects in the CSC3100 course. All projects are implemented using java. The scores of my four projects are all full marks, you should be able to rest assured (but not sure if there are bugs that have not been tested).

* project1：Implement a mathematical derivation parser.
* project2：Implement Huffman compression.
* project3：Use A* algorithm to solve Klotski (Huarong Dao).
* project4：Implement sparse matrices and their addition operations.
